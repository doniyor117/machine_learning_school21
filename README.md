# Machine Learning Fundamentals

A personal archive of my machine learning studies and experiments
These are not optimized for production, they are built to help grasp the underlying calculus and linear algebra before moving on to tools like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow."

Developed as part of the **School 21 (Ecole 42)** Data Science curriculum.

## 📂 Project Structure

| Project Directory | Description & Key Concepts |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **`ml1_introduction`** | **Data Analysis & EDA**: Introduction to data manipulation using Pandas/NumPy, statistical analysis, and data visualization. |
| **`ml2_supervised_learning`** | **Regression Models**: Implementation of linear regression algorithms, gradient descent, and cost function optimization. |
| **`ml3_validation_methods`** | **Model Evaluation**: Techniques for validating model performance, including Train/Test splits, Cross-Validation, and error metrics (RMSE, MSE). |
| **`ml4_classification`** | **Classification Problems**: Building models for binary and multi-class classification tasks (e.g., Logistic Regression). |
| **`ml5_decision_trees`** | **Tree-Based Models**: Implementation and visualization of Decision Trees for predictive modeling. (still working on it) |
| **and more will be soon...** |

## 📊 Dataset Information

*Note: Large datasets are not included in this repository to maintain strict version control.*

Each project folder contains a `data/` directory structure.
To reproduce the results run the cell for downloading the data from
kaggle ( it asks you your kaggle username and legacy API key ).
