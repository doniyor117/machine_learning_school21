# Machine Learning Fundamentals (School 21)

A collection of machine learning projects implementing core algorithms and data processing techniques. This repository focuses on the mathematical foundations of ML, including building models from scratch to understand the underlying logic before utilizing high-level libraries.

Developed as part of the **School 21 (Ecole 42)** Data Science curriculum.

## 📂 Project Structure

| Project Directory | Description & Key Concepts |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **`ml1_introduction`** | **Data Analysis & EDA**: Introduction to data manipulation using Pandas/NumPy, statistical analysis, and data visualization. |
| **`ml2_supervised_learning`** | **Regression Models**: Implementation of linear regression algorithms, gradient descent, and cost function optimization. |
| **`ml3_validation_methods`** | **Model Evaluation**: Techniques for validating model performance, including Train/Test splits, Cross-Validation, and error metrics (RMSE, MSE). |
| **`ml4_classification`** | **Classification Problems**: Building models for binary and multi-class classification tasks (e.g., Logistic Regression). |
| **`ml5_decision_trees`** | **Tree-Based Models**: Implementation and visualization of Decision Trees for predictive modeling. (still working on it) |
| **and more will be soon...** |
